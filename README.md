# optable-ios-sdk

Swift SDK for integrating with optable-sandbox from an iOS application.

## Build Demo App

[Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/) is required to build demo-ios-swift. After cloning the repo, simply run:

```
pod install
```

Then open up the generated `demo-ios-swift.xcworkspace` in [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) and build from there.
