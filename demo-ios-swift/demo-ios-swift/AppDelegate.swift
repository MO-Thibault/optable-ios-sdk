// The OPTABLE global points to an instance of OptableSDK which is initialized in the AppDelegate application() method at app launch.
// While we could have initialized the global directly here, due to Swift lazy-loading this would delay initialization to the first
// use of the SDK. While not strictly required, we want to force early initialization so that the SDK can detect the correct useragent
// to use in calls to the Optable Sandbox. Since useragent detection is an async process executed at OptableSDK init time, we want to
// ideally have init happen well before the first usage/API call if possible.
